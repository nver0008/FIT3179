          <h1>Transfers by Players</h1>
          <p>
            If you are unfamiliarly with a transfer fee, when a player is still
            contracted with a club for an upcoming season, a potential buyer
            will make a monetary offer to the club the player is contracted to
            for their contract to be terminated. From there, they are free to
            sign with the new club and discuss wages and bonuses. A player's
            value is dependent on a number of factors, including (but not
            limited to) age, form, injury history and career potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, we will review individual player movements at the
            end of the 2020-21 season. Note the large number of players being
            signed by a premier league club and are English. This is due to what
            is colloquially known as the "English Tax". This is because in the
            Premier League, every club is required to have a certain number of
            English players, and as such talented english players are a
            commodity and therefore clubs will pay higher fees to obtain their
            signatures.

            <h1>Club Expenditure</h1>
            <p>
              In this section, we explore the total expenditure of all the top
              clubs across the top 5 leagues; that being the Premier League
              (England + Wales), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A
              (Italy) and Ligue 1 (France). Typically, clubs with more buying
              power are those that have stronger backing by owners and have
              global awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manchester United and Arsenal are both hugely successful english
              clubs, and Manchester City are backed heavily financially in more
              recent times and have enjoyed massive domestic success.
            </p>
            <p>
              AS Roma spent big this window with some young talents, as did RB
              Leipzig as they challenge for the Bundesliga title, still looking
              for thier maiden trophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is no surpirse to see Paris Saint-Germain amongst the top
              spenders, but Stade Rennais and Aston Villa are both clubs that
              spent big this summer and don't typically spend that much on
              player deals. That being said, Aston Villa were the ones that sold
              record-breaking Jack Grealish, and therefore had some cash to
              spend to make up for the loss of their captain.

            <p>
              For the top 5 leagues, typically the players are sourced from
              Europe, especially those from their home nation. Outside of
              Europe, clubs tend to look to the Americas, in particular
              Argentina and Brazil, as well as in more recent times, the USA, in
              search of talent. Western Africa is growing in terms of number of
              players in the elite divisions and Asia and Oceania is lagging
              behind massively.

            <h1>Historical Transfers</h1>
            <p>
              Over the last 20 years, there has been a massive increase in the
              most expensive player. The record has been shattered a number of
              times, but none larger than the multi-hundred-million euro deal
              that saw Neymar move eastward to France. This transfer has since
              opened the gates for transfer records, where we are seeing a more
              inflated market to this date.
